# Multicomponent-SEI-Ion-Transfer-Project
This is a future-facing project aimed at sharing and giving aids for rechargable Lithium battery Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) researchers.

You will find a database of different SEI microstructures generated under different conditions, using different physical models and with varied properties.

In the near future, you will also be able to enjoy the convenience of our developing toolkit AlphaSEI, with which you will can predict the microstructure morphology and effective properties of SEI that has not been produced yet in reality. In this way, targets of ideal SEI will be set for your research.

Due to the file size and the uploading speed restrictions, this repo will not be completed quite soon. We have no other choice except for pleading for your patience, equanimity and understanding. This repo will also be frequently updated to rectify unforeseen mistakes or errors in the previous models and calculations. 

We sincerely appreciate your trust for using this repo. Any suggestions will be welcome. Please contact the author if any trouble arise through e-mail zhangjd20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.

This project is supported by the SRT project and the Spark project of Tsinghua University, for which we deliver our heartfelt gratitude.
